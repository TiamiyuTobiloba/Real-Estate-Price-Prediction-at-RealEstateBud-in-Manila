# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-at-RealEstateBud-in-Mania
**Introduction:**
RealEstateBud's challenge of accurately valuing properties in a dynamic market is effectively addressed by Multiple Linear Regression. This approach accommodates the diverse array of factors affecting property values, such as location, building features, access to public transportation, proximity to amenities, and the city center, to predict property prices.

**Aim:**
The project focuses on utilizing a data-driven approach to property valuation at RealEstateBud in Manila. The primary goal is to create a robust valuation model using Multiple Linear Regression, incorporating various factors. This model aims to significantly enhance the accuracy and transparency of property valuations, bridging the gap between estimated and actual property values.

**Tasks:**
1. **Data Importation & Cleansing:** Imported data into Excel and cleansed it by identifying and rectifying errors, missing values, data duplicates, and dates to ensure accuracy and reliability.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted basic exploration of the dataset to check for dirty or inconsistent data. Performed summary statistics of the outcome variable to understand the range of values. Created a correlation matrix to analyze the relationship between explanatory variables and the response variable.
3. **Model Development:** Built a Multiple Linear Regression model using the Analysis ToolPak in Microsoft Excel.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
